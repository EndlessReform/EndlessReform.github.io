							<p class="bi-accordionTop__text">Hey!  I'm Dinesh, and I'd be honored to serve you next year as the Undergraduate Liaison to the Board of Trustees.  I'm a member of the Class of 2022 and I’m pursuing a BA in Pub Pol with an MA in International Relations.  I’m very concerned about campus sustainability and continued complaints about SHS and SCS.  With the backing of University Trustees, I will pressure the administration to change on specific policy proposals, including those outlined below.  I'm especially involved with political and arts RSOs across campus, including the IOP, UC Dems, and Voices In Your Head.  At my high school in Washington, DC, I held major leadership positions and built personal relationships with my school’s board members and senior administrators.  Feel free to reach out and ask me any questions about the issues, my qualifications, or just to say hi!</p>

As Liaison, I will work to increase community engagement, promote local businesses and artists, and listen to the voices of the students and non-university community. One of my most rewarding experiences in high school was working with underprivileged families, and I hope to bring that love for community engagement to the table as Liaison. At my high school in LA, I had prior experience in student government and administrative work that will allow me to accomplish the goals on my platform. I hope to earn your vote in the election!</p>

							<p class="bi-accordionTop__text">Hi! My name is Aazer Siddiqui, and I'm a first-year majoring in linguistics and philosophy. I'm running to represent the class of 2022 on College Council because I'm not satisfied with the current state of this campus, especially on issues of sustainability. I've been on the front lines of environmental work — I volunteered on conservation projects with Americorps out West, and I've been involved in community-based sustainable design projects in and around my hometown, Boston. At the end of the day, we need people who care on College Council. We as students need to take a stand, and fight for what we deserve — a greener campus, better health services, and solidarity with grad students. I'm optimistic that we can work towards a brighter future together.</p>
